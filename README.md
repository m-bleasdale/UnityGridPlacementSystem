# UnityGridPlacementSystem
A grid based placement system complete with placement and rotation of variously sized object. Built in Unity.

## Current features:

- Easily add objects to placeable objects
- Select an object to place
- Place objects at desired location, with detection for if another object has been placed there
- Rotate objects

In the future, there would be need for the development of a object destruction feature.
